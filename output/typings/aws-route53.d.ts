     * Use this action to create or change your authoritative DNS information. To use
this action, send a POST request to the / Route 53 API version /hostedzone/ 
hosted Zone ID /rrset resource. The request body must include a document with a 
ChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest element.

Changes are a list of change items and are considered transactional. For more
information on transactional changes, also known as change batches, see POST
ChangeResourceRecordSets
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_ChangeResourceRecordSets.html] 
in the Amazon Route 53 API Reference .

Due to the nature of transactional changes, you cannot delete the same resource
record set more than once in a single change batch. If you attempt to delete the
same change batch more than once, Amazon Route 53 returns an InvalidChangeBatch 
error.In response to a ChangeResourceRecordSets request, your DNS data is changed on
all Amazon Route 53 DNS servers. Initially, the status of a change is PENDING .
This means the change has not yet propagated to all the authoritative Amazon
Route 53 DNS servers. When the change is propagated to all hosts, the change
returns a status of INSYNC .

Note the following limitations on a ChangeResourceRecordSets request:

 &amp;#42; A request cannot contain more than 100 Change elements.
 * A request cannot contain more than 1000 ResourceRecord elements.
 * The sum of the number of characters (including spaces) in all Value elements
   in a request cannot exceed 32,000 characters.

/hostedzone resource. The request body must include a document with a 
CreateHostedZoneRequest element. The response returns the 
CreateHostedZoneResponse element that contains metadata about the hosted zone.

Amazon Route 53 automatically creates a default SOA record and four NS records
for the zone. The NS records in the hosted zone are the name servers you give
your registrar to delegate your domain to. For more information about SOA and NS
records, see NS and SOA Records that Amazon Route 53 Creates for a Hosted Zone
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/SOA-NSrecords.html] in
the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

When you create a zone, its initial status is PENDING . This means that it is
not yet available on all DNS servers. The status of the zone changes to INSYNC 
when the NS and SOA records are available on all Amazon Route 53 DNS servers.

When trying to create a hosted zone using a reusable delegation set, you could
specify an optional DelegationSetId, and Route53 would assign those 4 NS records
for the zone, instead of alloting a new one.

by record type. This operation retrieves at most MaxItems resource record sets
from this list, in order, starting at a position specified by the Name and Type
arguments:

 &amp;#42; If both Name and Type are omitted, this means start the results at the first
   RRSET in the HostedZone.
 * If Name is specified but Type is omitted, this means start the results at the

 * It is an error to specify the Type but not the Name.

Use ListResourceRecordSets to retrieve a single known record set by specifying
the record set&#x27;s name and type, and setting MaxItems = 1

To retrieve all the records in a HostedZone, first pause any processes making
calls to ChangeResourceRecordSets. Initially call ListResourceRecordSets without
a Name and Type to get the first page of record sets. For subsequent calls, set
Name and Type to the NextName and NextType values returned by the previous
response.

In the presence of concurrent ChangeResourceRecordSets calls, there is no
consistency of results across calls to ListResourceRecordSets. The only way to
get a consistent multi-page snapshot of all RRSETs in a zone is to stop making
changes while pagination is in progress.

However, the results from ListResourceRecordSets are consistent within a page.
If MakeChange calls are taking place concurrently, the result of each one will
either be completely visible in your results or not at all. You will not see
partial changes, or changes that do not ultimately succeed. (This follows from
the fact that MakeChange is atomic)

The results from ListResourceRecordSets are strongly consistent with
ChangeResourceRecordSets. To be precise, if a single process makes a call to
ChangeResourceRecordSets and receives a successful response, the effects of that
change will be visible in a subsequent call to ListResourceRecordSets by that
process.

      /** Alias resource record sets only: If you set the value of EvaluateTargetHealth to 
true for the resource record set or sets in an alias, weighted alias, latency
alias, or failover alias resource record set, and if you specify a value for 
HealthCheckId for every resource record set that is referenced by these alias
resource record sets, the alias resource record sets inherit the health of the
referenced resource record sets.

In this configuration, when Amazon Route 53 receives a DNS query for an alias
resource record set:

       1. Amazon Route 53 looks at the resource record sets that are referenced by the
       alias resource record sets to determine which health checks they&#x27;re using.
       2. Amazon Route 53 checks the current status of each health check. (Amazon
       Route 53 periodically checks the health of the endpoint that is specified in
       a health check; it doesn&#x27;t perform the health check when the DNS query
       arrives.)
       3. Based on the status of the health checks, Amazon Route 53 determines which
       resource record sets are healthy. Unhealthy resource record sets are
       immediately removed from consideration. In addition, if all of the resource
       record sets that are referenced by an alias resource record set are
       unhealthy, that alias resource record set also is immediately removed from
       consideration.
       4. Based on the configuration of the alias resource record sets (weighted alias
       or latency alias, for example) and the configuration of the resource record
       sets that they reference, Amazon Route 53 chooses a resource record set from
       the healthy resource record sets, and responds to the query.

Note the following:

       &amp;#42; You cannot set EvaluateTargetHealth to true when the alias target is a
       CloudFront distribution.
       * If the AWS resource that you specify in AliasTarget is a resource record set
       or a group of resource record sets (for example, a group of weighted resource
       record sets), but it is not another alias resource record set, we recommend
       that you associate a health check with all of the resource record sets in the
       alias target. For more information, see What Happens When You Omit Health
       Checks?
       [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-complex-configs.html#dns-failover-complex-configs-hc-omitting]
       in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .
       * If you specify an ELB load balancer in AliasTarget , Elastic Load Balancing
       routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are registered
       with the load balancer. If no Amazon EC2 instances are healthy or if the load
       balancer itself is unhealthy, and if EvaluateTargetHealth is true for the
       corresponding alias resource record set, Amazon Route 53 routes queries to
       other resources.
       * When you create a load balancer, you configure settings for Elastic Load
       Balancing health checks; they&#x27;re not Amazon Route 53 health checks, but they
       perform a similar function. Do not create Amazon Route 53 health checks for
       the Amazon EC2 instances that you register with an ELB load balancer. For
       more information, see How Health Checks Work in More Complex Amazon Route 53
       Configurations
       [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-complex-configs.html]
       in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

We recommend that you set EvaluateTargetHealth to true only when you have enough
idle capacity to handle the failure of one or more endpoints.

Failover

      /** If you want Amazon Route 53 to return this resource record set in response to a
DNS query only when a health check is passing, include the HealthCheckId element
and specify the ID of the applicable health check.

Amazon Route 53 determines whether a resource record set is healthy by
periodically sending a request to the endpoint that is specified in the health
check. If that endpoint returns an HTTP status code of 2xx or 3xx, the endpoint
is healthy. If the endpoint returns an HTTP status code of 400 or greater, or if
the endpoint doesn&#x27;t respond for a certain amount of time, Amazon Route 53
considers the endpoint unhealthy and also considers the resource record set
unhealthy.

The HealthCheckId element is only useful when Amazon Route 53 is choosing
between two or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want
Amazon Route 53 to base the choice in part on the status of a health check.
Configuring health checks only makes sense in the following configurations:

       &amp;#42; You&#x27;re checking the health of the resource record sets in a weighted,
       latency, geolocation, or failover resource record set, and you specify health
       check IDs for all of the resource record sets. If the health check for one
       resource record set specifies an endpoint that is not healthy, Amazon Route
       53 stops responding to queries using the value for that resource record set.
       * You set EvaluateTargetHealth to true for the resource record sets in an
       alias, weighted alias, latency alias, geolocation alias, or failover alias
       resource record set, and you specify health check IDs for all of the resource
       record sets that are referenced by the alias resource record sets. For more
       information about this configuration, see EvaluateTargetHealth .

       Amazon Route 53 doesn&#x27;t check the health of the endpoint specified in the
       resource record set, for example, the endpoint specified by the IP address in
       the Value element. When you add a HealthCheckId element to a resource record
       set, Amazon Route 53 checks the health of the endpoint that you specified in
       the health check.
 
 

For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Amazon Route
53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region.
For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a state in the United
States, for the United States, for North America, and for all locations. If the
endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 checks
the resource record sets for the United States, for North America, and for all
locations (a resource record set for which the value of CountryCode is * ), in
that order, until it finds a resource record set for which the endpoint is
healthy.

If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend
that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a
health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com.
For the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName , specify the domain name of the
server (such as us-east-1-www.example.com ), not the name of the resource record
sets (example.com).

In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of 
FullyQualifiedDomainName matches the name of the resource record sets and then
associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results
will be unpredictable. **/

www.example.com. (with a trailing dot) as identical.

For information about how to specify characters other than a-z, 0-9, and -
(hyphen) and how to specify internationalized domain names, see DNS Domain Name
Format
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/DomainNameFormat.html] 
in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

You can use an asterisk (&amp;#42;) character in the name. DNS treats the * character
either as a wildcard or as the * character (ASCII 42), depending on where it
appears in the name. For more information, see Using an Asterisk (*) in the
Names of Hosted Zones and Resource Record Sets

Valid values for basic resource record sets: A | AAAA | CNAME | MX | NS | PTR | 
SOA | SPF | SRV | TXT

Values for weighted, latency, geolocation, and failover resource record sets: A 
| AAAA | CNAME | MX | PTR | SPF | SRV | TXT . When creating a group of weighted,
latency, geolocation, or failover resource record sets, specify the same value
for all of the resource record sets in the group.

SPF records were formerly used to verify the identity of the sender of email
messages. However, we no longer recommend that you create resource record sets
for which the value of Type is SPF . RFC 7208, Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for
Authorizing Use of Domains in Email, Version 1 , has been updated to say,
&quot;...[I]ts existence and mechanism defined in [RFC4408] have led to some
interoperability issues. Accordingly, its use is no longer appropriate for SPF
version 1; implementations are not to use it.&quot; In RFC 7208, see section 14.1, 
The SPF DNS Record Type [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208#section-14.1] .
Values for alias resource record sets:

       &amp;#42; CloudFront distributions: A
       * ELB load balancers: A | AAAA
       * Amazon S3 buckets: A
       * Another resource record set in this hosted zone: Specify the type of the
       resource record set for which you&#x27;re creating the alias. Specify any value
       except NS or SOA . **/

      SetIdentifier?:ResourceRecordSetIdentifier;
      /** Weighted resource record sets only: Among resource record sets that have the
same combination of DNS name and type, a value that determines the proportion of
DNS queries that Amazon Route 53 responds to using the current resource record
set. Amazon Route 53 calculates the sum of the weights for the resource record
sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type. Amazon Route 53 then
responds to queries based on the ratio of a resource&#x27;s weight to the total. Note
the following:

       &amp;#42; You must specify a value for the Weight element for every weighted resource
       record set.
       * You can only specify one ResourceRecord per weighted resource record set.
       * You cannot create latency, failover, or geolocation resource record sets that
       have the same values for the Name and Type elements as weighted resource
       record sets.
       * You can create a maximum of 100 weighted resource record sets that have the
       same values for the Name and Type elements.
       * For weighted (but not weighted alias) resource record sets, if you set Weight
       to 0 for a resource record set, Amazon Route 53 never responds to queries
       with the applicable value for that resource record set. However, if you set
       Weight to 0 for all resource record sets that have the same combination of
       DNS name and type, traffic is routed to all resources with equal probability.

       The effect of setting Weight to 0 is different when you associate health
       checks with weighted resource record sets. For more information, see Options
       for Configuring Amazon Route 53 Active-Active and Active-Passive Failover
       [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-configuring-options.html]

      /** Latency-based resource record sets only: The Amazon EC2 region where the
resource that is specified in this resource record set resides. The resource
typically is an AWS resource, such as an Amazon EC2 instance or an ELB load
balancer, and is referred to by an IP address or a DNS domain name, depending on
the record type.

You can create latency and latency alias resource record sets only in public
hosted zones.When Amazon Route 53 receives a DNS query for a domain name and
type for which you have created latency resource record sets, Amazon Route 53
selects the latency resource record set that has the lowest latency between the
end user and the associated Amazon EC2 region. Amazon Route 53 then returns the
value that is associated with the selected resource record set.

Note the following:

       &amp;#42; You can only specify one ResourceRecord per latency resource record set.
       * You can only create one latency resource record set for each Amazon EC2
       region.
       * You are not required to create latency resource record sets for all Amazon
       EC2 regions. Amazon Route 53 will choose the region with the best latency
       from among the regions for which you create latency resource record sets.
       * You cannot create non-latency resource record sets that have the same values
       for the Name and Type elements as latency resource record sets. **/
      Region?:ResourceRecordSetRegion;
      /** Geo location resource record sets only: A complex type that lets you control how
Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries based on the geographic origin of the
query. For example, if you want all queries from Africa to be routed to a web
server with an IP address of 192.0.2.111 , create a resource record set with a 
Type of A and a ContinentCode of AF .

You can create geolocation and geolocation alias resource record sets only in
public hosted zones.If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping
geographic regions (for example, one resource record set for a continent and one
for a country on the same continent), priority goes to the smallest geographic
region. This allows you to route most queries for a continent to one resource
and to route queries for a country on that continent to a different resource.

You cannot create two geolocation resource record sets that specify the same
geographic location.

The value &amp;#42; in the CountryCode element matches all geographic locations that
aren&#x27;t specified in other geolocation resource record sets that have the same
values for the Name and Type elements.

Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations. However, some IP
addresses aren&#x27;t mapped to geographic locations, so even if you create
geolocation resource record sets that cover all seven continents, Amazon Route
53 will receive some DNS queries from locations that it can&#x27;t identify. We
recommend that you create a resource record set for which the value of 
CountryCode is * , which handles both queries that come from locations for which
you haven&#x27;t created geolocation resource record sets and queries from IP
addresses that aren&#x27;t mapped to a location. If you don&#x27;t create a * resource
record set, Amazon Route 53 returns a &quot;no answer&quot; response for queries from
those locations.You cannot create non-geolocation resource record sets that have
the same values for the Name and Type elements as geolocation resource record
sets. **/

PRIMARY as the value for Failover ; for the other resource record set, you
specify SECONDARY . In addition, you include the HealthCheckId element and
specify the health check that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform for each
resource record set.

You can create failover and failover alias resource record sets only in public
hosted zones.Except where noted, the following failover behaviors assume that
you have included the HealthCheckId element in both resource record sets:

       &amp;#42; When the primary resource record set is healthy, Amazon Route 53 responds to
       DNS queries with the applicable value from the primary resource record set
       regardless of the health of the secondary resource record set.
       * When the primary resource record set is unhealthy and the secondary resource
       record set is healthy, Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the
       applicable value from the secondary resource record set.
       * When the secondary resource record set is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 responds
       to DNS queries with the applicable value from the primary resource record set
       regardless of the health of the primary resource record set.
       * If you omit the HealthCheckId element for the secondary resource record set,
       and if the primary resource record set is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 always
       responds to DNS queries with the applicable value from the secondary resource
       record set. This is true regardless of the health of the associated endpoint.

You cannot create non-failover resource record sets that have the same values
for the Name and Type elements as failover resource record sets.

For failover alias resource record sets, you must also include the 
EvaluateTargetHealth element and set the value to true.
