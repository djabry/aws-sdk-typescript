    /**
     * Creates a new, empty file system. The operation requires a creation token in the
request that Amazon EFS uses to ensure idempotent creation (calling the
operation with same creation token has no effect). If a file system does not
currently exist that is owned by the caller&#x27;s AWS account with the specified
creation token, this operation does the following:

 &amp;#42; Creates a new, empty file system. The file system will have an Amazon EFS
   assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state &quot;creating&quot;.
 * Returns with the description of the created file system.

Otherwise, this operation returns a FileSystemAlreadyExists error with the ID of
the existing file system.

For basic use cases, you can use a randomly generated UUID for the creation
token.The idempotent operation allows you to retry a CreateFileSystem call without
risk of creating an extra file system. This can happen when an initial call
fails in a way that leaves it uncertain whether or not a file system was
actually created. An example might be that a transport level timeout occurred or
your connection was reset. As long as you use the same creation token, if the
initial call had succeeded in creating a file system, the client can learn of
its existence from the FileSystemAlreadyExists error.

The CreateFileSystem call returns while the file system&#x27;s lifecycle state is
still &quot;creating&quot;. You can check the file system creation status by calling the 
DescribeFileSystems API, which among other things returns the file system state.
After the file system is fully created, Amazon EFS sets its lifecycle state to
&quot;available&quot;, at which point you can create one or more mount targets for the
file system ( CreateMountTarget ) in your VPC. You mount your Amazon EFS file
system on an EC2 instances in your VPC via the mount target. For more
information, see Amazon EFS: How it Works
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html]

This operation requires permission for the elasticfilesystem:CreateFileSystem 
action.

    /**
     * Creates a mount target for a file system. You can then mount the file system on
EC2 instances via the mount target.

You can create one mount target in each Availability Zone in your VPC. All EC2
instances in a VPC within a given Availability Zone share a single mount target
for a given file system. If you have multiple subnets in an Availability Zone,
you create a mount target in one of the subnets. EC2 instances do not need to be
in the same subnet as the mount target in order to access their file system. For
more information, see Amazon EFS: How it Works
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html] .

In the request, you also specify a file system ID for which you are creating the
mount target and the file system&#x27;s lifecycle state must be &quot;available&quot; (see 
DescribeFileSystems ).

In the request, you also provide a subnet ID, which serves several purposes:

 &amp;#42; It determines the VPC in which Amazon EFS creates the mount target.
 * It determines the Availability Zone in which Amazon EFS creates the mount
   target.
 * It determines the IP address range from which Amazon EFS selects the IP
   address of the mount target if you don&#x27;t specify an IP address in the
   request.

After creating the mount target, Amazon EFS returns a response that includes, a 
MountTargetId and an IpAddress . You use this IP address when mounting the file
system in an EC2 instance. You can also use the mount target&#x27;s DNS name when
mounting the file system. The EC2 instance on which you mount the file system
via the mount target can resolve the mount target&#x27;s DNS name to its IP address.
For more information, see How it Works: Implementation Overview
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html#how-it-works-implementation] 
.

Note that you can create mount targets for a file system in only one VPC, and
there can be only one mount target per Availability Zone. That is, if the file
system already has one or more mount targets created for it, the request to add
another mount target must meet the following requirements:

 * The subnet specified in the request must belong to the same VPC as the
   subnets of the existing mount targets.
   
   
 * The subnet specified in the request must not be in the same Availability Zone
   as any of the subnets of the existing mount targets.

If the request satisfies the requirements, Amazon EFS does the following:

 * Creates a new mount target in the specified subnet.
 * Also creates a new network interface in the subnet as follows: * If the
      request provides an IpAddress , Amazon EFS assigns that IP address to the
      network interface. Otherwise, Amazon EFS assigns a free address in the
      subnet (in the same way that the Amazon EC2 CreateNetworkInterface call
      does when a request does not specify a primary private IP address).
    * If the
      request provides SecurityGroups , this network interface is associated
      with those security groups. Otherwise, it belongs to the default security
      group for the subnet&#x27;s VPC.
    * Assigns the
      description &quot;Mount target fsmt-id for file system fs-id &quot; where fsmt-id is
      the mount target ID, and fs-id is the FileSystemId .
    * Sets the requesterManaged property of the network interface to &quot;true&quot;, and
      the requesterId value to &quot;EFS&quot;.
   
   Each Amazon EFS mount target has one corresponding requestor-managed EC2
   network interface. After the network interface is created, Amazon EFS sets
   the NetworkInterfaceId field in the mount target&#x27;s description to the network
   interface ID, and the IpAddress field to its address. If network interface
   creation fails, the entire CreateMountTarget operation fails.
   
   

The CreateMountTarget call returns only after creating the network interface,
but while the mount target state is still &quot;creating&quot;. You can check the mount
target creation status by calling the DescribeFileSystems API, which among other
things returns the mount target state.We recommend you create a mount target in
each of the Availability Zones. There are cost considerations for using a file
system in an Availability Zone through a mount target created in another
Availability Zone. For more information, go to Amazon EFS
[http://aws.amazon.com/efs/] product detail page. In addition, by always using a
mount target local to the instance&#x27;s Availability Zone, you eliminate a partial
failure scenario; if the Availability Zone in which your mount target is created
goes down, then you won&#x27;t be able to access your file system through that mount
target.

    /**
     * Deletes the specified mount target.

This operation forcibly breaks any mounts of the file system via the mount
target being deleted, which might disrupt instances or applications using those
mounts. To avoid applications getting cut off abruptly, you might consider
unmounting any mounts of the mount target, if feasible. The operation also
deletes the associated network interface. Uncommitted writes may be lost, but
breaking a mount target using this operation does not corrupt the file system
itself. The file system you created remains. You can mount an EC2 instance in
your VPC using another mount target.

system CreationToken or the FileSystemId is provided; otherwise, returns
descriptions of all file systems owned by the caller&#x27;s AWS account in the AWS
region of the endpoint that you&#x27;re calling.

When retrieving all file system descriptions, you can optionally specify the 
MaxItems parameter to limit the number of descriptions in a response. If more
file system descriptions remain, Amazon EFS returns a NextMarker , an opaque
token, in the response. In this case, you should send a subsequent request with
the Marker request parameter set to the value of NextMarker .

So to retrieve a list of your file system descriptions, the expected usage of
this API is an iterative process of first calling DescribeFileSystems without
the Marker and then continuing to call it with the Marker parameter set to the
value of the NextMarker from the previous response until the response has no 
NextMarker .

Note that the implementation may return fewer than MaxItems file system
descriptions while still including a NextMarker value.
