   * Amazon GameLift ServiceWelcome to the Amazon GameLift API Reference . Amazon GameLift is a managed
   Amazon Web Services (AWS) service for developers who need a scalable,
   server-based solution for multiplayer games. Amazon GameLift provides setup and
   deployment of game servers, and handles infrastructure scaling and session
   management. For more information about the GameLift service, including a feature
   overview, getting started guide, and tutorial, see the accompanying Amazon
   GameLift Developer Guide
   [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/] .

   This reference describes the low-level service API for GameLift. You can call
   this API directly or use the AWS SDK [https://aws.amazon.com/tools/] for your
   preferred language. The AWS SDK includes a set of high-level GameLift actions
   multiplayer game sessions. Alternatively, you can use the AWS command-line
   interface [https://aws.amazon.com/cli/] (CLI) tool, which includes commands for
   GameLift. For administrative actions, you can use the Amazon GameLift console.

   Managing Game and Player Sessions Through GameLift

   Call these actions from your game clients and/or services to create and manage
   multiplayer game sessions.

   * DescribeGameSessions
   * DescribeGameSessionDetails
   * UpdateGameSession


   * Player sessions * CreatePlayerSession
   * CreatePlayerSessions
   * DescribePlayerSessions


   * Other actions: * GetGameSessionLogUrl



   Setting Up Game Servers

   Use these administrative actions to configure GameLift to host your game
   servers. When configuring GameLift, you&#x27;ll need to (1) configure a build for
   your game and provide build files, and (2) set up one or more fleets to host
   game sessions.

    /**
     * Creates an alias for a fleet. You can use an alias to anonymize your fleet by
referencing an alias instead of a specific fleet when you create game sessions.
Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and
terminal. Use a simple alias to point to an active fleet. Use a terminal alias
to display a message to incoming traffic instead of routing players to an active
fleet. This option is useful when a game server is no longer supported but you
want to provide better messaging than a standard 404 error.

To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional
description. If successful, a new alias record is returned, including an alias
ID, which you can reference when creating a game session. To reassign the alias
to another fleet ID, call UpdateAlias .

    /**
     * Initializes a new build record and generates information required to upload a
game build to Amazon GameLift. Once the build record has been created and is in
an INITIALIZED state, you can upload your game build.

To create a build, use the CLI command upload-build , which creates a new build
record and uploads the build files in one step. (See the Amazon GameLift
Developer Guide [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/] for
more details on the CLI and the upload process.) Call the CreateBuild action
only if you have your own Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) client and
need to manually upload your build files.

To create a new build, optionally specify a build name and version. This
metadata is stored with other properties in the build record and is displayed in
the GameLift console (but not visible to players). If successful, this action
returns the newly created build record along with an Amazon S3 storage location
and AWS account credentials. Use the location and credentials to upload your
game build.

    /**
     * Creates a new fleet to host game servers. A fleet consists of a set of Amazon
Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances of a certain type, which defines
the CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity of each host in the fleet. See 
Amazon EC2 Instance Types [https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/] for more
information. Each instance in the fleet hosts a game server created from the
specified game build. Once a fleet is in an ACTIVE state, it can begin hosting
game sessions.

To create a new fleet, provide a name and the EC2 instance type for the new
fleet, and specify the build and server launch path. Builds must be in a READY
state before they can be used to build fleets. When configuring the new fleet,
you can optionally (1) provide a set of launch parameters to be passed to a game
server when activated; (2) limit incoming traffic to a specified range of IP
addresses and port numbers; (3) set game session protection for all instances in
the fleet, and (4) configure Amazon GameLift to store game session logs by
specifying the path to the logs stored in your game server files. If the call is
successful, Amazon GameLift performs the following tasks:

 &amp;#42; Creates a fleet record and sets the state to NEW.
 * Sets the fleet&#x27;s capacity to 1 &quot;desired&quot; and 1 &quot;active&quot; EC2 instance count.
 * Creates an EC2 instance and begins the process of initializing the fleet and
   activating a game server on the instance.
 * Begins writing events to the fleet event log, which can be accessed in the
   GameLift console.

Once a fleet is created, use the following actions to change certain fleet
properties (server launch parameters and log paths cannot be changed):

 * UpdateFleetAttributes -- Update fleet metadata, including name and
   description.
 * UpdateFleetCapacity -- Increase or decrease the number of instances you want
   the fleet to maintain.
 * UpdateFleetPortSettings -- Change the IP addresses and ports that allow
   access to incoming traffic.

session record and assigns the new session to an instance in the specified
fleet, which activates the server initialization process in your game server. A
fleet must be in an ACTIVE state before a game session can be created for it.

To create a game session, specify either a fleet ID or an alias ID and indicate
the maximum number of players the game session allows. You can also provide a
name and a set of properties for your game (optional). If successful, a 
GameSession object is returned containing session properties, including an IP

simultaneously.

A scaling policy rule statement has the following structure:

minutes, then [ScalingAdjustmentType] to/by [ScalingAdjustment] .

For example, this policy: &quot;If the number of idle instances exceeds 20 for more

implemented as the following rule statement:

If [IdleInstances] is [GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold] [20] for [15] minutes,
then [ChangeInCapacity] by [-10].
